Balloon man is a village fair toy native to Bangladesh now on the verge of extinction, or already extinct.

Now, I cannot even find an image of it by doing a long streak of search in google.

To put it in words, the shape is anthropomorphic, without the limbs. It has a head and torso made of a piece of long balloon and divided by a string. It has its facial features made of a paper cutout pasted using glue of rice. The base of the toy is made of a cardboard, with some added weight of mud so that whenever we throw it, it lands on its 'feet'.
