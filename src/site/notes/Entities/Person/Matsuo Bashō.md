Art is, to me, the most authentic self-expression. Beauty is secondary. Art thrives on our individuality, on our differences. This also implies that art is a mode of living. And how Bashō lived art!

Bashō lived art in that time. He practised Zen. He immersed himself in writings of his predecessors. He preached his way of poetry and lived by his rules with absolute honesty. He taught himself to be one with the nature, as if its transiency is his owns. He had an acute [[Entities/Concept/Aesthetics/Mono no aware\|mono no aware]]. When he wrote about nature, he wrote about himself.  
  
And, what did he achieve? To me, Bashō is synonymous with excellence.
