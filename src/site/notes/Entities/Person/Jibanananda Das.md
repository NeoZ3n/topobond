[Jibanananda Das](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jibanananda_Das) is one of the greatest of all Bengali poets. Though [[Entities/Person/Rabindranath Tagore\|Tagore]] was doubtful of some of his works, ironically, Jibananada's modernity owes most to Tagore himself. In fact, Jibanananda's modern works (all after his first poetry book) got many inspirations from [[Entities/Person/Rabindranath Tagore#Tagore and Modernity\|Tagore's experiments]].

Jibanananda's strong suite though is an acute [[Entities/Concept/Aesthetics/Mono no aware\|mono no aware]], wielded masterfully like none before him. It is so strong that even when expressing human expressions, this pathos of things will be the dominant feeling.

Through and through, Jibananada is a modern man with modern crisis. So much so that his writings has uncanny similarities with coeval western writer [[Entities/Person/Fernando Pessoa\|Fernando Pessoa]]'s [[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/The Book of Disquiet_ The Complete Edition by Fernando Pessoa\|Book of Disquiet]], written over the same time yet published much later. Surely, Jibanananda couldn't have read those.
