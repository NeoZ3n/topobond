Evey Hammond is one of the central characters of [[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/V for Vendetta by Alan Moore\|V for Vendetta]].

Evey symbolizes the people— gullible, powerless, and the ones to be tormented by the government.

Moore used Evey as his medium to express certain key points of V for Vendetta, namely, how England came to be under fascist rule, and what it meant for common people—distress, torment, and docility.
