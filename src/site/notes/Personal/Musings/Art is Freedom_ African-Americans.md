But if you have a feeling for the music, you can understand him, and that's why he keeps it so important to himself. And he's always been trying. The black man, he's been learning his way from the beginning.

When the black cargoes landed, and slaves walked out all they had was music.

Music, that eased their torment in tobacco and cotton fields.

Then came the Ragtime, Blues, and Jazzâ€” sharing the African root and pathos.

It was music all along. Music is African-American's one true spirituality.
