Food for thought for sure, *From Hell* is a complex piece of work with many layers of human emotions, expressions, and delusions.

One thing I particularly like about Alan Moore is his all-pervading kindness to everyone he presents in his works, both villains and heroes, victims and criminals.

So, we see Sir William Gull— a genius, a murderer, deranged to many but sure of his superiority only found his true nature of derangement and inferiority in his visit to a higher plain.

There are some memorable panels and monologues that will keep me thinking for quite a while.

Although Moore used Hinton's fourth dimension as a central concept of this work, he— probably with his modern sense of four-dimensional space understood the fourth dimension as *time*, whereas Hinton's was an [[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/What is the Fourth Dimension by Charles Howard Hinton#^a63817\| Euclidean one]]. However, since the Euclidean dimensions are all spatial it may have helped Moore to think along the line where he can craft a simile like the panels above— where he compared the causality with architecture.

A masterpiece!
